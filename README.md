# 2d Drone Simulation with PyGame

This is a 2D Simulation of a Drone using different Algorithms to navigate through some sort of labyrinths, which are either user made or randomly generated.

TODO: Add doc that one pixel corresponds to conversion factor in environment and that everything is calculated in metres, only when we blit something we need to convert it back to pixels!! 
+My own Coordinate System is at bottom Left!!!!!
